		<h2>Food waste in Egypt</h2>
		<p>
			In Egypt, the food waste per capita reached <b>91 kilograms</b> in 2021, in comparison to <b>73kg</b>, <b>60 Kg and 50</b>kg in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, according El Dostor newspaper depending on FAO data. The more people increase, the more waste per capita will be.


		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Egypt climbs the top of the highest contributing countries to food waste percentages with <b>73 kilograms</b> total annual amount of global food waste per person.

			According to a study conducted by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition (BCFN), Egypt comes in the sixteenth place after Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Palestine among others.
			
			The BCFN has listed a total of 25 countries who are the major contributors to the global food waste percentages..</p>

					The Egyptian House of Representatives is considering a new draft law on regulating food waste and encouraging its redistribution, recycling and donation, a step taken to cope with the repercussions of increasing population, limited food production resources, and the ongoing global economic crisis of food chain supply.

                <br>
			<h2>Why is food waste a problem?</h2>
            <p>
				In addition to households, restaurants, hotels and grocery stores regularly throw out perfectly edible and delicious meals. While this is highly problematic all year, during Ramadan, a minimum of <b>60%</b> of all food goes in the trash, largely due <b>  to excess shopping for holiday entertainment purposes</b>

	Unlike in nature where food rots away slowly on or near to the surface of the soil, in large rubbish dumps where organic waste undergoes a very different decomposition process, it produces methane, which is approximately 30 times more damaging to the environment than carbon dioxide. To tackle this problem and also aid farmers in producing crops at greater rates,at lower cost, and without the need for chemical fertilisers, various organisations have popped up in Egypt that create compost from food waste.

			<h2>What can we do to reduce food waste?</h2>
			<p>There are many ways to reduce food waste, such as:</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Planning meals and buying only what you need</li>
				<li>Using leftovers and making the most of ingredients</li>
				<li>Storing food properly to extend its shelf life</li>
				<li>Donating excess food to local charities and food banks</li>
				<li>Composting food scraps to create nutrient-rich soil</li>
			</ul>
